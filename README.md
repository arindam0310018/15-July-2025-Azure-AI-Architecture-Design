# AZURE AI ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN:-

In order to adopt AI based workloads in a consistent and production ready way, __An Azure AI Landing Zone is a MUST.__

| <img src="/Images/1-Banner.jpg"> |
| --------- |

| ðŸ“Œ WHY AZURE AI LANDING ZONE IS REQUIRED:- |
| --------- |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Standardization__ - Develop and Promote the use of Blueprint(Predefined Templates) to deploy AI Services. |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Faster Time to Market__ - Less time on Infrastructure, more focus on building AI solutions. |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Security__ - Azure Policies, Network Isolation, Use of Managed Identities, RBAC, Encryption at rest/transit, Certificates. |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Scalability__ - Support onboarding of New AI Uses cases without Re-Architecture. |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Operational Excellence__ - Implementation of Observability and FinOps. Addtionally for AI Lifecycle Management, DevOps/MLOps working Hand to Hand. |

| ðŸš€ AGENDA:- |

| __ðŸ’¡Myths of Data Science.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡Breakdown of AI based on Technology and Implementation.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡Breakdown of AI based on User interactions and Development.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡How All Fits Together.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡Decision Tree.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡Hub and Spoke Model for AI.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡Classical ML Architecture.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡Model Platform Architecture.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡Analytics Platform Architecture.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡Low Code No Code Architecture.__ |
| __ðŸ’¡Consumption Model - APIM and MCP.__ |
