| --------- |

| ðŸ“Œ WHY AZURE AI LANDING ZONE IS REQUIRED:- |
| --------- |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Standardization__ - Develop and Promote the use of Blueprint(Predefined Templates) to deploy AI Services. |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Faster Time to Market__ - Less time on Infrastructure, more focus on building AI solutions. |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Security__ - Azure Policies, Network Isolation, Use of Managed Identities, RBAC, Encryption at rest/transit, Certificates. |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Scalability__ - Support onboarding of New AI Uses cases without Re-Architecture. |
| ðŸŽ¯ __Operational Excellence__ - Implementation of Observability and FinOps. Addtionally for AI Lifecycle Management, DevOps/MLOps working Hand to Hand. |
